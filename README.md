This is a simple Angular web application that can run offline by cashing the endpoints responses and resources using *service workers*

## Running the application

1. npm i

2. install a node server "npm i http-server -g"

3. build the applicatiom "npm run build --prod"

4. run the application using http-server

p.s: make sure to run it using localhost:port so that service workers can function properly
